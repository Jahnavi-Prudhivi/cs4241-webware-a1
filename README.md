Objective: The goal is to familiarize with HTML and CSS in this assignment. The first part, index.html, had information about me, a short description about my future plan, my majors, previous CS courses and technologies I’m familiar with for this class, CS 4241 Webware, only. The second part, hobby.html, is a form for users to answer questions related to their hobbies. These questions had form elements including input text box, text area, check boxes, radio buttons, drop down selection list, labels, and a submit button. There is also a navigation bar and additional items I added for achievements.

### Technical Achievements

- **StylingPage using an external sheet called`style.css`**: In this, I applied styles for the table (th, td), menu unordered lists, the introduction header (Jahnavi Prudhivi and Hobby), changed the background color of the body, font and color change for header 2, the navigation menu bar background color and the paragraphs colors.
- **Experiment with additional semantic HTML tags`**: I used links for Google font and my watercolor hobby, a footer for my contact information, a header for the navigation menu bar, I used section for the little introduction “About me” bit.
